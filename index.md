This is the `Trussels' Guide`, written by Trussels for Trussels. We share it here for others to see how we try to do what we do.

We have two guides published right now:

* The [`Trussel's Guide to Truss`](trussels), which is about Truss, the organization.
* The [`Truss Distributed Playbook`](distributed), which is about distributed work.
* The [`How to Open Source like a Trussel`](opensource), which is about how we do OSS software.
