This is the `Trussels' Guide`, written by Trussels for Trussels. We share it here for others to see how we try to do what we do.

We have the following guides published right now:

* The [`Trussels' Guide to Truss`]({{ '/docs/trussels' | relative_url }}), which is about Truss, the organization.
* The [`Truss Distributed Playbook`]({{ '/docs/distributed' | relative_url }}), which is about distributed work.
* The [`How to Open Source like a Trussel`]({{ '/docs/opensource/opensource' | relative_url }}), which is about how we do OSS software.

These are licensed [CC-BY 4.0 International]({{ '/docs/opensource/LICENSE-CC-BY-4.0' | relative_url }}).
